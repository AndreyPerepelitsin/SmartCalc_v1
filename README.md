## Introduction
In this project, you will use structured programming to implement an extended version of the standard calculator found in the standard applications of every operating system, using the C programming language. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, you need to add the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.).
Besides calculating expressions, it should also support the use of the x variable and the graphing of the corresponding function.
As for other improvements you could consider a credit and deposit calculator.
